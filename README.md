#  Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

An AI/ML project that detects spam emails using **TF-IDF text vectorization**
and **Multinomial Naive Bayes**, with a **Streamlit web interface** for real-time predictions.

---

##  Project Overview

Spam emails are a major cybersecurity and productivity issue.  
This project builds an **end-to-end spam detection system** that classifies
emails/messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
and Machine Learning.

The project covers:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Model training with Naive Bayes
- Model evaluation
- Deployment using Streamlit
